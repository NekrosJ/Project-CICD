# Step 1: Use official Node.js image to build the app
FROM node:16 AS build

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json to install dependencies
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the React app
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Use Nginx to serve the build files
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy build files from the previous image
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 for the app
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx to serve the app
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
